# TM_RSA
An implementation of RSA I made for a school project,
It can :
  * Generate a public/private key pair
  * Use custom keys
  * Encrypt and decrypt text strings
  
Best to use on windows, untested on other OSes

**WARNING: This is an UNSAFE implementation of RSA, use only for educational purposes**
